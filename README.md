## Tests

Tests can be run in a web browser [here](tests.html).

## Development

Files can be hosted locally via tools like [`http-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server), [Live Server - Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer), etc.

Tests can be run locally in a web browser [here](tests.html) and local solving of puzzles against actual input on [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com/) can be done with the following Console script:

```js
import(`http://127.0.0.1:5500/solveCurrentPuzzle.js?${Date.now()}`);
```

Note: The added query parameter in the above `import` statement is to facilitate iterative development by bypassing the browser cache (a unique URL is used each time).
